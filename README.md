# Exploiting-XXS-Vulnerability
In this project, I deployed OWASP Juice Shop, an intentionally vulnerable web application, on an AWS EC2 instance to explore and exploit security vulnerabilities, particularly Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This hands-on experience provided valuable insights into web security and cloud computing.
# Tools:
Tech Used: Docker, AWS EC2, Burp Suite

In this project, I leveraged a combination of web technologies and cloud services to deploy and test OWASP Juice Shop, a deliberately insecure web application designed to educate users about common security vulnerabilities.
